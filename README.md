# bookworm
A mediocre goodreads clone that uses the janky Google Books API.

This web app would work better if it utilized an better API, namely the ISBNdb one. However, I'm extremely cheap, so too bad. This is also like, the first thing I've ever really made, so that's probably the more important reason why it doesn't work too well.
